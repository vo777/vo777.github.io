we wanted to ask .. to tell us about her trip
tell what you did
I was in Argentina, it was very hot and stuffy
I was there for only two days, one of them - in the airport
I met new friends
It was very fun and interesting
Did you speak English with your friends?
Their native language is Spanish
I tried to use new words that I learned
Will you go back to Argentina?
I am tired, but I have many new impressions
It made me stronger
I was there for one night
I stayed there one night
Of course
People there always smile
I din't have time to dance with them
Next time I go there, I will do it

I'm afraid by the evening I will be hungry
Before breakfast, I was hungry
After breakfast, I am afraid of nothing
Are you afraid of something?

I am tired of everything
