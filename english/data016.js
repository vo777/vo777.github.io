I watch you
I will go with you to them
I made this shirt for me
I don't want to speak with him about it
What you tell me will be between us
be yourself
she is very far from me
her mind sometimes is very far from my mind
he wanted to speak with me about it, but I refused
I hope you will do it for me
think about it!
